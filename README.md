This mod is (vaguely) based around Quantum (&Nucear) stuff, as you can tell by the name. 
What does this mod add:
100+ Jokers
10+ Consumables
1 edition (currently)
5+ Decks
10+ Seals
4 Vouchers

Additional:
all cards are undiscovered to provide at least 
a semblence of a challange in finding them all.

Fun Fact:
This mod started out as a herdcode project, but it was ABSOLUTE
AGONY to hardcode, scince there was basically NO documentation.
So this new version is made in Jokerforge.
old version: https://github.com/DamianH10/OLD-Quantum-Mod-balatro

How 2 install:
1. Copy the folder; Quantum
2. Put it into your Mods folder (in Balatro)
3. Done

There will also be a folder with .zip files for all Versions
acting as a lib for older versions and early access (for minor updates).
btw: .zip files are soooo much easier to upload than a whole 100 file PLUS
raw mod file (Git hub prevents uploading more than 100 files at a time, very annoying).

Rights/Copyright:
idk, do whatever you want, just credit me ig.
